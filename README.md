# Shopping List

In this project, I have developed a website which is used to show the list of shopping items. It takes shopping items as inputs from the user and displays them in the webpage. I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for doing this project.

This repository includes 3 files,
shopping.html, shopping.css, shopping.js.
